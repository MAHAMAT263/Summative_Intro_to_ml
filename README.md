## Classification Model Training and Evaluation For Loan approval 

## Problem Statement
Traditional loan approval processes suffer from inefficiencies, human biases, and inconsistencies that undermine fairness and trust. Manual processes are time-consuming and often lead to inaccuracies, resulting in financial exclusion or high default rates.

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based loan classification system to assist financial institutions in predicting the likelihood of loan approval. Traditional loan approval processes are often inefficient, prone to human bias, and time-consuming. By leveraging supervised machine learning algorithms, this system will analyze key features such as income, etc… to provide accurate and fair predictions.


## Dataset
The project utilized public datasets from Kaggle’s loan classification dataset.

## Objectives
1. Preprocess the dataset containing key loan application features.
2. Develop and train a supervised machine learning model with at least 90% accuracy.
3. Test and validate the system’s effectiveness.
